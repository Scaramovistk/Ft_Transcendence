# ft_transcendence
It is a group project with the aim of developing a website accessible via HTTPS that hosts the classic game PONG.

## About ft_transcendence?
The BackEnd must be built using Python(Django), the FrontEnd made with HTML, CSS(Bootstrap toolkit) and JavaScript and the database must be [PostgreSQL.](https://www.postgresql.org/)

There are no restraints in regards to external libraries and the website but it needs to be a [single-page application.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application) It should be compatible with [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en-US/chrome/).

The user must log in using after doing the registration in the system and be able to use a [two-factor authentication](https://authy.com/what-is-2fa/) method, for which we chose the [Google Authenticator App.](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2&hl=en_US&gl=US)

Overall, the platform should have a ranking system, profile editing, AI opponent, tournament system ,view users status, friend features and some profile customization options.

The main purpose is to play an implementation of [Pong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong), as if it was [1972.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiShX2pTz9A) all over again

Finally, the server structure must be containerized using [docker](https://www.docker.com/) and available with a single call of: **docker-compose up --build**.

In this project we need to choose 7 major modules (2 minor module = 1 major), the picked ones where the following:

### Web
  Major module: Use a Framework as backend.
  Minor module: Use a front-end framework or toolkit.
  Minor module: Use a database for the backend.
### User Management

### Gameplay and user experience
  Major module: Remote players
### IA-Algo
